<center><h3>Orpool's Privacy Policy</h3></center>
Your privacy is essential to us. Orpool believes that integrity of privacy must be a top priority.
We know that you care how information about you is used and shared. Thus, we provide this
Privacy Policy to summarize our procedures and practices as regards to information collection,
use, communication and disclosure of personal information. This will serve you as a guide in making
an intelligent decision in sharing your information with us. <br /><br />

By visiting Opool, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and hereby accept the procedures and
practices stated herein. The following outlines our privacy policy.<br /><br />

<h4>Scope</h4>
This Privacy Policy applies only within this website and other pages where this policy appears.
This would describe and explain how we take care and handle your personal information you shared
with us. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in signing up or using this site in
other ways, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal
information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />

<h4>Collection and Use</h4>
If you attempt to use the services and applications of our website and or choose to provide information
to us, this website shall collect Personal Information from you. This information includes, but is not limited
to: name, date of birth, gender, city and country of residence and/or email. Once collected, we will store
your information for a necessary period of time for record keeping purposes and to help provide Orpool’s
service. <br /><br />

<h4>Disclosure</h4>
We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention
or investigation. We may do so in other cases and when:
<ol>
	<li>permitted or required by law; or,</li>
	<li>trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; or, </li>
	<li>investigating fraud which has already taken place.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
The Site may use cookie and tracking technology depending on the features offered. Cookie and tracking
technology are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the
number of visitors to the Site, and understanding how visitors use the Site. Cookies can also help customize
the Site for visitors.<br /><br />

<h4>Security</h4>
Orppol strives to protect personal information from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no data transmission
over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect our end-users'
personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us,
and you do so at your own risk.<br /><br />

<h4>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h4>
When you use our services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information
and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise
required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves
and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we
may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise
required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access,
correct or delete users’ personal information. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with
law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
enforce our policies and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.<br /><br />

<h4>Third Parties</h4>
We provide links to Web sites outside of our web sites, as well as to third party Web sites. These linked sites
are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies linked to our
website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms
and conditions of using that Web site and its privacy statement.<br /><br />

<h4>Minors</h4>
This Website is not intended for visitors that are minors under fifteen (15) years of age. Orpool does not
knowingly solicit or collect information from individuals under the age of fifteen (15). If we determine that
we have inadvertently collected personal information from someone under fifteen (15) years of age, we will
take reasonable steps to purge this information from our database. We encourage parents and guardians to
spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the Internet activities of their children.
Minors above the age fifteen (15) must seek the consent of a parent or guardian in order to use the services
of this site.<br /><br />

<h4>Additional Components of this Policy</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which
	information is being collected.</li>
	<li>We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes
	specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual
	concerned or as required by law.</li>
	<li>We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the
	knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.</li>
	<li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent
	necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
	<li>We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well
	as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li>
	<li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating
	to the management of personal information.</li>
</ul>
